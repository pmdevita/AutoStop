# AutoStop

Automatically stop a Minecraft server when no players are connected.

## About

Plugin does just one thing, turn off when nobody is on. There aren't any permissions, just a config file where
you can set how long for the server to wait before turning off.

## Instructions

Plugin is really simple so there isn't much to do but best to include this for those who don't know.

1. Add to your plugins folder in Spigot
2. Edit the config.yml to change the delay
3. Done!
